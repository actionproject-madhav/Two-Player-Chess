# Two Player Chess
 Play chess with your friends offline anywhere. Have fun with a timed chess game where you don't need a chessboard or a chess clock. You can download the chess.dmg file or run the python script. Have fun!


 Note: If you are running the chess.py through IDE, it has image dependencies. The images can be found under the chess folder. Download them and make an "images" folder under the project directory to pull the images correctly.
